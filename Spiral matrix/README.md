# Spiral Matrix

This repository contains a Python script that generates an `n x m` matrix filled with numbers from 1 to `n*m` in a spiral pattern.

## Description

This project is created for practice purposes to demonstrate my ability to write Python code that solves specific problems. The script takes user input for the number of rows and columns and generates a matrix filled with numbers in a spiral order.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rygosc/Practice.git
    cd Practice/Spiral\ matrix
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python matrix.py
    ```

3. Enter the number of rows and columns when prompted:
    ```
    Enter the number of rows and columns (separated by space): 4 5
    ```

4. The script will output the matrix in a spiral pattern.

## Example

If you enter `4 5` as the number of rows and columns, the output will be:

1 2 3 4 5
14 15 16 17 6
13 20 19 18 7
12 11 10 9 8


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
